# Hi there, I'm Josh!

After years of working building elevators and working in construction, I am ready to pursue a career in information technology with a longer-term goal of transitioning into security. The elevator industry has prepared me for this transition by helping me develop strong technical and problem-solving skills, which I am now applying to IT. This page will serve as a means to build on my skills and showcase my growing skill set. Follow along as I build on my expertise!
